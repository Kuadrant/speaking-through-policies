# Speaking Through Policies

Talk for the Cloud Native Barcelona Meetup (March 2025.)

ðŸ”— https://www.meetup.com/cloud-native-bcn/events/306257941/

## Description

In a cloud-native world, platform engineers and application developers each have their own focus areasâ€”security, scalability, reliability, and application logic. But how do they collaborate effectively without stepping on each otherâ€™s toes? Gateway Policies provide a structured way to define responsibilities and ensure alignment across teams. This talk explores how policies in Kubernetesâ€”like networking, security, and traffic managementâ€”enable separation of concerns while fostering collaboration. Weâ€™ll dive into real-world scenarios where policies help teams work together seamlessly, ensuring consistency, compliance, and flexibility in modern cloud environments.

## The demo

The talk develops as a live demo play of the day-to-day interaction between 3 personas involved in the running of service applications on a Kubernetes cluster.
