# Speaking Through Policies

Talk for the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://cncf.io) Community Groups:
- Barcelona, Spain (March 2025) | ðŸ”— https://www.meetup.com/cloud-native-bcn/events/306257941/
- MÃ¡laga, Spain (July 2025) | ðŸ”— https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-malaga-presents-cloud-native-talks-speaking-through-policies/

## Description

In a cloud-native world, platform engineers and application developers each have their own focus areasâ€”security, scalability, reliability, and application logic. But how do they collaborate effectively without stepping on each otherâ€™s toes? Gateway Policies provide a structured way to define responsibilities and ensure alignment across teams. This talk explores how policies in Kubernetesâ€”like networking, security, and traffic managementâ€”enable separation of concerns while fostering collaboration. Weâ€™ll dive into real-world scenarios where policies help teams work together seamlessly, ensuring consistency, compliance, and flexibility in modern cloud environments.

## The demo

The talk develops as a live demo play of the day-to-day interaction between 3 personas involved in the running of service applications on a Kubernetes cluster.

### Tech

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/)
- [Envoy Gateway](https://gateway.envoyproxy.io/)
- [Kuadrant](https://kuadrant.io/)
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/)
- [Amazon Route 53 Cloud DNS Service](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)
- [AWS Load Balancer Controller](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/latest/)

### Requisites & Tweaks

To run the demo, you need the following tools installed on your system:

- [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/introduction/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
- [curl](https://curl.se/)
- [jq](https://jqlang.org/)
- [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)

You will also need:

- A Kubernetes cluster | We are using [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks)
- AWS Access key with permission to manage hosted managed zones in Route53

Export the credentials as the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` shell variables.

The demo uses a public managed zone `demos.kuadrant.io`. Make sure to replace that across all commands with the FQDN associated to your hosted zone.
